Users must manually check each item's count, which is not efficient for larger inventories.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Functionality\r\n- **Automatic Movement**: When the count of any stock item falls below 2, it should automatically be moved to a dedicated 'Running Low' tab.\r\n","createdAt":"2024-01-19T04:12:32Z","number":7,"state":"OPEN","title":"`Feat` -  Auto-Move Low Stock Items to 'Running Low' Tab","updatedAt":"2024-01-19T04:12:32Z"},{"body":"\r\nUsers are experiencing significant performance issues while interacting with the dashboard table.
